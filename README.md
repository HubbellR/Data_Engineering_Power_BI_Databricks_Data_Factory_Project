# Data_Engineering_Power_BI_Databricks_Data_Factory_Project
This end to end data engineering project starts with a source CSV file which is then loaded into a MS sql server database. The database is then migrated to a data factory self-hosted instance. From here, a databricks cluster aggregates data. It is imported from the cluster to power BI where table is used to make an interactive dashboard.
